Dale young,"I am a psychologist practicing for over 20 years. My approach is to listen to you, understand the difficulties you have, and develop a way that we can work together so that you are able to deal with the issues that matter to you. I will talk with you. I work--mostly--with people with depression, anxiety, and/or trauma and help people who feel unhappy with themselves and/or who are having difficulties with others. I also work with people who feel they are not dealing well with changes in their life or believe they need to make changes.
Coming to therapy for the first time/again isn't easy. I pay attention to what may make it difficult. I treat the first visit as an opportunity to begin to know you and for you to get to know me, as well as explore what you want from psychotherapy.
Over the years, I have studied many different psychotherapy techniques and approaches. Everyone has a unique psychology. I have had the good fortune to work with many different kinds of people--by age, race, ethnicity,sex/ sexual orientation, income, culture and geography--and welcome it.",,"Adoption

Geoffrey Whitley,"Hi! I am a medication and/or therapy provider. I use a very client-centered approach in therapy and utilize CBT and narrative therapy frequently. I have a strong belief that the mind and body are highly integrated and that physical and mental treatment are inseparable. For this reason, clients have the option of participating in a new model of treatment. This would include exercising during therapy sessions - brisk or slow walking on treadmills or Stairmaster at the client's comfort level. Of course, regular counseling therapy and/or medication prescriptions are provided for those not interested in combining exercise.
Along with these therapeutic techniques, weight loss through medication, supplement use, and food consumption recommendations can be an aspect of treatment. Genesight Genetic testing is also available to determine the most likely medications that will work for a client.
Ages 8 years and up are welcome for treatment. I accept Blue Cross insurance and cash/credit cards on sliding scale. Parking is available and I am readily accessible through public transportation. Saturday and Sunday appointments are available.","Depression

He is also really honest about what he thinks. I love his questions. They draw me past mental blocks I hadn't known were there until I look back from the other side. I always imagined psychiatrists' offices were cold places but he lets emotions into the room. He has a kind of genius with pain that is hard to describe.

Henry Friedman,"I am a psychiatrist trained in psychotherapy and psychoanalysis. My practice has been directed at individuals who have difficulty finding satisfaction in both their work and love lives despite having achieved considerable success in their professions. I have been seeing individuals and couples for over 30 years and I am experienced with providing combined therapy, including medication and psychotherapy. I work with patients from 1x/week to 4x/week depending on the patient's need for more or less intensive therapy. While the past as a determinant of the present is acknowledged the work is done in the here and now.
As a psychiatrist-psychoanalyst I can offer the best approach to helping patients move forward in their lives. I believe that my ability to prescribe drugs where needed for depression or anxiety when combined with my understanding of the sources of emotional distress on an interpersonal basis is uniquely effective.
Many individuals who seek my help are deeply unhappy and suffer from the choices they have made in life when they lacked the assertiveness necessary to get more from their work or love situations. I have been able to address the present sources of unhappiness without neglecting the past sources.",,,,,"Years in Practice: 30+ Years

Jonathan Perry,"I've been doing this for a long time, and I've done my best work with clients who are asking these questions: Who have I been, who am I now, and who do I want to be? If you're depressed; if your relationships have fallen apart; if you've been through some horrible experiences-then those are probably important questions for you. I'll do my best to help you rediscover your strength and your confidence in finding your own answers and daring to live them. ""Hope"" will be our tool, and ""wellness"" will be our path together.
My primary specialty is bipolar disorder. I focus especially on the concept of ""bipolar wellness"", meaning our figuring out together not only how to achieve mood stability and symptom reduction but also how to create and sustain a life that is worth living and staying well for.
I also facilitate ""bipolar wellness groups"" for individuals with bipolar disorder. These groups offer relief from the isolation of bipolar; strategies to live a fulfilling life; encouragement to keep on living well when the going gets rough; and a support group to help with tough decision-making. My Bipolar Wellness Groups bring together individuals with bipolar disorder so that they can help each other with feelings of isolation; with ideas and strategies to live a more fulfilling life; with encouragement to keep on living well when it just seems too hard; with good-natured confrontation when someone is about to make a bad or dangerous decision; and with validating their ""interesting"" sense of humor (we laugh a lot). We meet weekly, and we spend a lot of time getting to know each other so we can celebrate together when good things happen.","Bipolar Disorder

We both felt he gave us poor advice which was that we were not right for each other and should stop seeing each other. We are working things out on our own ....he made us realize we can do this without his help.,"Dr. Mark Nickolas has been a wonderful therapist.  I felt at ease with him immediately, and he instills trust immediately.  He is a great listener, very thoughtful with his approach and words, respectful at all times, open-minded to situations, solutions, and ideas, and overall, an inspiring and motivating individual to work with.  I highly recommend him for anyone that would like to improve their mental health and/or hear another's perspective on any situation.  I've found time spent rewarding."

Out of Network","After experiencing depression for years and taking many antidepressants whose efficacy would eventually fade in time, I did not ever think I would feel anything other than ""bleh"". TMS changed my life in that I was able to feel the way I did before acquiring depression. I was able to remember what it was like to feel anything other than ""okay"" at my best and my depression fog of tiredness, apathy, and numbness was gone. TMS helped me to feel more energetic, positive, and happy in my life and has proved more effective than any antidepressant I've ever tried. I would highly recommend TMS to anyone with depression, as it is highly beneficial. My words of encouragement are that: one does not have to experience the gloomy effects of depression; there is a solution so that s/he does not have to suffer. If you're on the fence about TMS, I would definitely give it a shot.","Dr. Haque and his team are incredibly sincere in their care for their patients. At first, it may seem too good to be true: Dr. Haque is intelligent and caring, the treatment is 100% safe and incredibly effective, the insurance is easy and taken care of by Dignity. However, it's completely true. Upon reflecting on TMS and my own health, I realized I haven't felt this stable in several years. TMS is an amazing option for those experiencing depression and mood disorders and Dr. Haque (and all those at Dignity: Paige, Paul, Laura, and Lady) make the experience as easy and comfortable as possible. They truly live up to their name and treat each patient with dignity."

Out of Network",Dr. Williams was dismissive and unprofessional and uncaring with me.   As soon as I entered the office he began giving me ADHD questionnaires.  He did not evaluate any other diagnoses.  He also suggested that my husband had ADHD  based on his profession alone. In addition to this he discussed his own diagnosis of ADHD and who his provider was for this interaction. When I tried to talk to him about my concerns he said were based on my relationship with my parents.  He took no history about this.,"Dr. Williams has been the only psychologist able to actually provide help. He listens and provides honest, direct feedback, along with helpful suggestions that have helped me immensely. He has helped get to the very deep root of why I feel the way I do and how to work to address it head on. No other psychologist has even come close. Would definitely recommend."

In most cases, they are feeling a loss of control over some important aspect of their lives. This loss of control results in symptoms such as depression, anxiety, stress, feelings of guilt or shame, family problems, relationship problems, or problems at work or school. It is my goal to help you regain control of your life!
By talking through your problems in therapy, you can discover options of feeling, thinking, and behaving that you never allowed yourself to have. This increased sense of freedom leads to greater happiness and a sense of hope that your future can be better.

Theodore Wasik,"*Please note that Dr. Wasik is currently not accepting any new patients for the treatment of ADD/ADHD.
 
 Dr. Theodore P. Wasik has worked as a clinician and researcher in psychiatry and psychology for almost thirty years. In his private practice in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Dr. Wasik sees patients with complaints of depression, anxiety, and self-esteem problems, which is often expressed as self-doubt and self-criticism. Also seen are patients who repeatedly do self-destructive things, whether it be from OCD or trouble resisting certain kinds of impulses. An area of specialty for Dr. Wasik are those patients who have bodily symptoms or pain where psychological factors play a role, such as IBS, fibromyalgia, chronic back pain, and other psychosomatic complaints. The treatment used by Dr. Wasik for any of these problems is therapy on a once-a-week or more frequent basis, with psychoanalysis being available for those patients seeking an even more intensive form of treatment. Medication may be prescribed, but only conservatively and where needed. Patients seeking medication management only are also welcome. 
 
 Dr. Wasik earned his Bachelorâs degree in psychology at the Catholic University of America and later studied neuroscience at the University of Pittsburgh. Training in medicine and psychiatry at Temple University School of Medicine and the Medical College of Virginia was followed by advanced training in psychoanalysis at the Boston Psychoanalytic Society & Institute. Today Dr. Wasik specializes in the treatment of adult patients, ages 18 and over, at his comfortable, converted Victorian house-turned-office at 61 Roseland Street, Cambridge, MA.
 
 Please visit my website for further information on my practice.
