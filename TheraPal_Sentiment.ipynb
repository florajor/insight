      "Mark is the best therapist I have ever encountered. My son was sinking into depression and refusing help. Mark became the first therapist my son agreed to keep seeing. Mark has a remarkable ability to hone in on issues that need attention. But he does so with humor and a vast reservoir of knowledge. He is incredibly perceptive and intellectually agile. He will shift the direction of a session in a second if he senses a symptom that needs to be addressed. He gave full attention to my son, and has earned his trust. Within a few months, my son went from being depressed and withdrawn to a new stage where he is now confident and moving ahead with life. I feel very fortunate to have found such a talented, compassionate and intuitive therapist who has led the path to my son’s healing and helped him believe in himself and his future. He may have saved my son’s life. I have the highest praise for Mark and his extraordinary skills and highly recommend him to anyone who needs help. {'neg': 0.041, 'neu': 0.704, 'pos': 0.256, 'compound': 0.993}\n",

As a psychiatrist, many of the medications Dr. Weiner prescribes have the potential for both addiction and negative side effects.

      "1. He is professional, personable, and easy to talk to \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "2. He is transparent in his diagnosis and evaluation of your condition\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "3. He is accommodating and understanding; he will work with you on providing solutions that best meet your needs given your personal circumstances. He is also flexible and willing to work with you if you have a particular preference on treatment given it is appropriate and within reason.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "4. He is a Great guy and very down to earth; he is genuine and a straight shooter - he tells it like he sees it and won't mislead you. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "5. he, as already mentioned, is flexible and cares about his patients and how to best meet their needs (even post consultation). As an example, post consultation, he'll give you the option to have your prescription (if applicable) electronically sent to your preferred pharmacy or give to you as a hard copy\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "6. He is extremely helpful when it come to dealing with insurance providers; he will accommodate your insurance provider with necessary documentation and receipt; evenif the provider is out of netwrork.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Overall - I would highly recommended Chike and was extremely satisfied with how my appointment went.\r\n",

      "He makes you feel incredibly safe, when you feel at your most vulnerable state. He listens to what you are actually saying to him, and truly wants to help his patients get well. I had almost lost hope, but I found Dr, Chike, and he has given me a new found faith that there are still medical professionals who actually care about their patients.  {'neg': 0.043, 'neu': 0.719, 'pos': 0.239, 'compound': 0.921}\n",

      "Dr. Chike's office is readily accessible by T and he offers Saturday appointments, both of which are very helpful to working professionals. That said, in my experience he is not responsive to patient communications, and I had a lot of difficulty getting in touch with him regarding scheduling, prescriptions, and invoicing. I got the impression that my only option was to book an appointment via ZocDoc. This may well be par for the course for Boston psychiatrists; I would not know, as Dr. Chike is the first I've seen since moving here. If that is the case, however, that policy was not explained. I was never given a copy of Dr. Chike's policy(ies) regarding email and/or phone communications, or clear and consistent directions regarding how to contact him, and the lack of clarity coupled with delayed or nonexistent responses made for some frustration. \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "More importantly, I felt very uncomfortable during my most-recent appointment with Dr. Chike. My discomfort stemmed in part from the fact that I intended it to be our final appointment, and ending any kind of relationship is usually awkward. I was also stressed about getting copies of my invoices and other necessary documentation before the end of the appointment, given that prior requests for these documents hadn't been answered in light of the communication issues described above.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Most of my discomfort, however, stemmed from a few of Dr. Chike's comments about my demeanor and facial expressions when I asked for these documents and thanked him for providing them. In particular, as the appointment was ending, I was taken aback by the language he used to comment on my appearance (specifically, that my smile creeped him out). I imagine this wasn't his intent, but I felt insulted and as if I were being made fun of, which was very upsetting in the moment and a sour note on which to end the relationship. {'neg': 0.081, 'neu': 0.861, 'pos': 0.058, 'compound': -0.7613}\n",

      "Dale Young is hands-down the best therapist I've ever had—and I say this with some considerable experience (virtual client expertise!), having worked majorly (long-term: 2+yrs) with 2 psychotherapists, and 2 short-term therapists (1-5 visits). Dr. Young is not one to indulge in her own revelations, or in her own persona, but remarkably stays focused (and keeps the client) on their feelings & perspectives. I have been with Dr. Young weekly for now 2.3 years, and I have experienced remarkable progress never experienced or imagined, being an obviously \"complicated situation.\" I never thought to see this much change in 2 years, and I can now see the \"light at the end of the tunnel\" that would conclude formal therapy for me (finally). Moreover, at nearly 60 myself, she does not make one feel that they cannot change more, if they want to! My suggestions would be that, if you don't think she would work out for you in the first few visits, you might still do well to stick it out till about 10 or so. Her skill comes thru in long-term, unexpected ways, producing for one a remarkable -looking back, and forward! If you're into real person-to-person therapy, and not merely pharmaceuticals of these days, I recommend her wholeheartedly. R.D.\r\n",
