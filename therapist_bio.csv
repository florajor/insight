Whether you’re coping with anxiety, depression or problems in your couple relationship, together we'll explore strategies for reducing stress and moving forward in a hopeful direction.
Couples learn to understand each other’s perspective and reach respectful compromises on difficult issues. There will be no blaming or judging in our therapy sessions. The focus will be on nurturing your relationship with greater empathy and trust.
After each session, you’ll have a ""takeaway"" for further reflection or action. I welcome your feedback to ensure our conversations are helpful. The easiest way to reach me is via email--please be sure to include your availability on Tuesday or Thursdays. I look forward to hearing from you.","Marital and Premarital

Geoffrey Whitley,1,"Hi! I am a medication and/or therapy provider. I use a very client-centered approach in therapy and utilize CBT and narrative therapy frequently. I have a strong belief that the mind and body are highly integrated and that physical and mental treatment are inseparable. For this reason, clients have the option of participating in a new model of treatment. This would include exercising during therapy sessions - brisk or slow walking on treadmills or Stairmaster at the client's comfort level. Of course, regular counseling therapy and/or medication prescriptions are provided for those not interested in combining exercise.
Along with these therapeutic techniques, weight loss through medication, supplement use, and food consumption recommendations can be an aspect of treatment. Genesight Genetic testing is also available to determine the most likely medications that will work for a client.
Ages 8 years and up are welcome for treatment. I accept Blue Cross insurance and cash/credit cards on sliding scale. Parking is available and I am readily accessible through public transportation. Saturday and Sunday appointments are available.","Depression

Eric Zhou,1,"Are you struggling from sleepless nights and feel like you have ""tried everything"" to improve your sleep? If you are tired of feeling tired and want to make meaningful changes to your sleep, I can help. Imagine what it would feel like to wake up in the morning and feel rested, refreshed, and ready to take on your day. This is possible without the use of prescription or over-the-counter medications. Even if you have trouble shutting your mind off at night, or are coping with anxiety or depression, we can work together to significantly improve your sleep at night. With better sleep comes the strength to tackle your biggest challenges.
I specialize in delivering brief, evidence-based, drug-free sleep treatments. I was trained at the University of Miami, Brown University, and Harvard Medical School and am committed to helping you take realistic steps towards improving the psychological and emotional health goals that are meaningful for you.

Jonathan Perry,1,"I've been doing this for a long time, and I've done my best work with clients who are asking these questions: Who have I been, who am I now, and who do I want to be? If you're depressed; if your relationships have fallen apart; if you've been through some horrible experiences-then those are probably important questions for you. I'll do my best to help you rediscover your strength and your confidence in finding your own answers and daring to live them. ""Hope"" will be our tool, and ""wellness"" will be our path together.
My primary specialty is bipolar disorder. I focus especially on the concept of ""bipolar wellness"", meaning our figuring out together not only how to achieve mood stability and symptom reduction but also how to create and sustain a life that is worth living and staying well for.
I also facilitate ""bipolar wellness groups"" for individuals with bipolar disorder. These groups offer relief from the isolation of bipolar; strategies to live a fulfilling life; encouragement to keep on living well when the going gets rough; and a support group to help with tough decision-making. My Bipolar Wellness Groups bring together individuals with bipolar disorder so that they can help each other with feelings of isolation; with ideas and strategies to live a more fulfilling life; with encouragement to keep on living well when it just seems too hard; with good-natured confrontation when someone is about to make a bad or dangerous decision; and with validating their ""interesting"" sense of humor (we laugh a lot). We meet weekly, and we spend a lot of time getting to know each other so we can celebrate together when good things happen.","Bipolar Disorder

Dale young,0,"I am a psychologist practicing for over 20 years. My approach is to listen to you, understand the difficulties you have, and develop a way that we can work together so that you are able to deal with the issues that matter to you. I will talk with you. I work--mostly--with people with depression, anxiety, and/or trauma and help people who feel unhappy with themselves and/or who are having difficulties with others. I also work with people who feel they are not dealing well with changes in their life or believe they need to make changes.
Coming to therapy for the first time/again isn't easy. I pay attention to what may make it difficult. I treat the first visit as an opportunity to begin to know you and for you to get to know me, as well as explore what you want from psychotherapy.
Over the years, I have studied many different psychotherapy techniques and approaches. Everyone has a unique psychology. I have had the good fortune to work with many different kinds of people--by age, race, ethnicity,sex/ sexual orientation, income, culture and geography--and welcome it.",,"Adoption

As a psychiatrist, I diagnose and treat people with anxiety, mood instability, insomnia, and attention deficits. As an executive coach, I help clients manage work stress, overcome burnout, make career transitions, develop leaderships skills, and improve their overall functioning.

Henry Friedman,0,"I am a psychiatrist trained in psychotherapy and psychoanalysis. My practice has been directed at individuals who have difficulty finding satisfaction in both their work and love lives despite having achieved considerable success in their professions. I have been seeing individuals and couples for over 30 years and I am experienced with providing combined therapy, including medication and psychotherapy. I work with patients from 1x/week to 4x/week depending on the patient's need for more or less intensive therapy. While the past as a determinant of the present is acknowledged the work is done in the here and now.
As a psychiatrist-psychoanalyst I can offer the best approach to helping patients move forward in their lives. I believe that my ability to prescribe drugs where needed for depression or anxiety when combined with my understanding of the sources of emotional distress on an interpersonal basis is uniquely effective.
Many individuals who seek my help are deeply unhappy and suffer from the choices they have made in life when they lacked the assertiveness necessary to get more from their work or love situations. I have been able to address the present sources of unhappiness without neglecting the past sources.",,,,,"6 Garden Terrace

Stephen Wiener,0,"When people decide to come to therapy, they are struggling. They are stressed, suffering, and feeling stuck or lost. In most cases, they are feeling a loss of control over some important aspect of their lives. This loss of control results in symptoms such as depression, anxiety, stress, feelings of guilt or shame, family problems, relationship problems, or problems at work or school. It is my goal to help you regain control of your life!
By talking through your problems in therapy, you can discover options of feeling, thinking, and behaving that you never allowed yourself to have. This increased sense of freedom leads to greater happiness and a sense of hope that your future can be better.
I custom fit my approach to who you are as an individual. Through talk therapy, I will help you learn how to overcome the internal and external obstacles that are preventing you from having peace of mind, happiness, and a satisfying life.","Relationship Issues

Theodore Wasik,0,"*Please note that Dr. Wasik is currently not accepting any new patients for the treatment of ADD/ADHD.
 
 Dr. Theodore P. Wasik has worked as a clinician and researcher in psychiatry and psychology for almost thirty years. In his private practice in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Dr. Wasik sees patients with complaints of depression, anxiety, and self-esteem problems, which is often expressed as self-doubt and self-criticism. Also seen are patients who repeatedly do self-destructive things, whether it be from OCD or trouble resisting certain kinds of impulses. An area of specialty for Dr. Wasik are those patients who have bodily symptoms or pain where psychological factors play a role, such as IBS, fibromyalgia, chronic back pain, and other psychosomatic complaints. The treatment used by Dr. Wasik for any of these problems is therapy on a once-a-week or more frequent basis, with psychoanalysis being available for those patients seeking an even more intensive form of treatment. Medication may be prescribed, but only conservatively and where needed. Patients seeking medication management only are also welcome. 
 
 Dr. Wasik earned his Bachelor’s degree in psychology at the Catholic University of America and later studied neuroscience at the University of Pittsburgh. Training in medicine and psychiatry at Temple University School of Medicine and the Medical College of Virginia was followed by advanced training in psychoanalysis at the Boston Psychoanalytic Society & Institute. Today Dr. Wasik specializes in the treatment of adult patients, ages 18 and over, at his comfortable, converted Victorian house-turned-office at 61 Roseland Street, Cambridge, MA.
